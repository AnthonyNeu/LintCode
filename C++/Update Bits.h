/*
Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. 
Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e g , M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j).


Example
Given N=(10000000000)2, M=(10101)2, i=2, j=6

return N=(10001010100)2

Note
In the function, the numbers N and M will given in decimal, you should also return a decimal number.

Challenge
Minimum number of operations?

Clarification
You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. 
That is, if M=10011ï¼Œ you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. 
You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.

public:
    /**
     *@param n, m: Two integer
     *@param i, j: Two bit positions
     *return: An integer
     */
    int updateBits(int n, int m, int i, int j) {
        // write your code here
        int right_part = n & ((1 << i) - 1);
        // The behavior of right shift >= 32 is undefined in C++.
        int left_part = j >= 31 ? 0 : (n >> (j + 1)) << (j + 1);
        return left_part | (m << i) | right_part;
    }
