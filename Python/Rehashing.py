"""
The size of the hash table is not determinate at the very beginning. If the total size of keys is too large (e.g. size >= capacity / 10), we should double the size of the hash table and rehash every keys. Say you have a hash table looks like below:

size=3, capacity=4

[null, 21, 14, null]
       ↓    ↓
       9   null
       ↓
      null
The hash function is:

int hashcode(int key, int capacity) {
    return key % capacity;
}
here we have three numbers, 9, 14 and 21, where 21 and 9 share the same position as they all have the same hashcode 1 (21 % 4 = 9 % 4 = 1). We store them in the hash table by linked list.

rehashing this hash table, double the capacity, you will get:

size=3, capacity=8

index:   0    1    2    3     4    5    6   7
hash : [null, 9, null, null, null, 21, 14, null]
Given the original hash table, return the new hash table after rehashing .
